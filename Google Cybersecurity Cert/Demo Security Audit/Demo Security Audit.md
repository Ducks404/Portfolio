### Reflection

I gained practical experience in conducting a security audit as a junior analyst, reviewing senior analyst's work and giving input in deciding controls and compliance framework.

From the exemplars I realize my lack of experience in terms of vocabulary, severity consciousness, and control uses.

Overall, I enjoyed this demo and am now interested in looking more into conducting audits for organizations.
